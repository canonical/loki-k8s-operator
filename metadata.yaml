  Loki for Kubernetes cluster
summary: |
  Unlike other logging systems, Loki is built around the idea of only indexing metadata
  about your logs: labels (just like Prometheus labels).
  Log data itself is then compressed and stored in chunks in object stores such as S3 or GCS,
  or even locally on the filesystem. A small index and highly compressed chunks simplifies
  the operation and significantly lowers the cost of Loki.
