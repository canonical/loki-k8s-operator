# Based on https://awesome-prometheus-alerts.grep.to/rules.html#loki
# The Loki charm may restart the workload on config-changed event, which means there would be
# two restarts just from deploying the charm.
# Changing the config soon after deploy (e.g. set resource limits) would cause another restart.
# Using 5 as the alert threshold to take into account restart (2 starts) + immediate config change (1 more start).
